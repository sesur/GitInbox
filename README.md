# GitInbox (exploring TDD in a SwiftUI)

Iâ€™m writing a GitHub notifications viewer iOS app to explore TDD in a SwiftUI World. 

There will be Xcode project configuration. There will be architecture, design, and refactoring. There will be test-driven development (TDD). And how will I approach SwiftUI?

Inspiration source is Jon Reid from https://qualitycoding.org
